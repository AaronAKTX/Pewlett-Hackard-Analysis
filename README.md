# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Employees born between 1952 and 1955 are at or near retirement age. Pewlett Hackard has many employees that fall in that age category. This analysis queried the PH database for all employees in that age bracket to prepare for the potential impact of a large group of people retiring in a relatively small period of time. The analyis also included the title of the soon to be retired peron in order to gain an understanding of which jobs would be most impacted. We summed the total retirement age employee by job title as well and found some interesting results. For example, Pewlett-Hackard will probably need to start promoting to or hiring some Senior lever Engineers and Staff member as many of them may soon be retired. Finally, a search for employees born in 1965 only for some reason, was conducted as a way of finding potential participants in a mentorship program.

## Results: 

-- The Retirement Age Employees by Job Title
<img src = "https://github.com/AaronAKTX/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/PyBer_Dataframe.PNG">
-- Senior Level Positioned Employees will be Moving on Soon.
The table above clearly shows a very high number of Senior level Engineers and Staff members are at a retirement age.

-- Management is Fine
Only two managers are in the retirement age range, so let's not go looking to hire more managers. 

-- The Mentorship Program Can Help Prepare for the Tsunami of Retirees
A transitioning program that will allow older employees to begin the retirement process while also contributing to the maintanence of the high quality of work is great idea. Only searching for people born in 1965, which is completely arbitrary, yielded a large list of 1549 employees that could mentor newer employees until they were at the point of taking Senior level responsibility. Expanding the age range or looking instead at years with the Pwelett-Hackard would definitely lead to even more potential mentors.

-- Summary

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
